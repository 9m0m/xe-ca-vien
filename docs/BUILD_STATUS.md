# Xe Cá Viên — Build Status

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1 — Repository Foundation (COMPLETE)
- **Tooling & Setup**:
  - Initialized Git with `main` branch and remote `https://github.com/9m0m/xe-ca-vien.git`.
  - pnpm 9 + Node.js 22 + React 19 + strict TypeScript + Vite 6 + Tailwind CSS + Phaser 3.90.
  - Vercel Function integration with Hono 4 + Zod schema validation under `/api/v1/...`.
  - ESLint 9 flat config + Prettier formatting.
  - Vitest test suite with jsdom.
- **Frontend Architecture**:
  - Vietnamese street-food tokens (inox, street-cart red, chalkboard slate, sauce colors) defined via CSS variables.
  - Anti-AI-slop rule enforced: No emoji UI (Lucide SVG icons only), no glassmorphism, no purple/blue AI gradients.
  - `GameShell`: Mobile-first responsive wrapper (390×844 CSS px) with bounded desktop framing, HUD coin & level display, sound & music settings drawer.
  - `ErrorBoundary` & `LoadingScreen`: Street-food cart themed states with authentic Vietnamese copy.
  - `PhaserContainer`: React wrapper mounting Phaser 3 with strict canvas lifecycle cleanup to eliminate WebGL memory leaks.
  - `useAppStore`: Zustand store managing UI state strictly isolated from Phaser GameObjects.
- **Verification**: Typecheck, lint, format, tests, and production build all passed.

### Phase 2 — Cooking Vertical Slice (COMPLETE)
- **Data Model & Catalog**:
  - Generic `FoodItemConfig` interface in `src/game/types.ts` defining cook timings, perfect windows, rewards, shapes, and serving styles.
  - Initial Tier 1 catalog seeded in `src/game/data/catalog.ts` (`fish_ball_classic`, `beef_ball_classic`, `sausage_red`, `fish_tofu`).
- **Cooking Engine & State Machine**:
  - `CookingManager` handles 6 pan frying slots, time elapsed, state transitions (`raw` -> `cooking` -> `perfect` -> `overcooked`), and capacity bounds.
  - Interactive frying: Tap food item on prep tray to fly & drop into the hot oil with `oil_splash` particle burst.
  - Visual frying feedback: Continuous oil bubbles, circular progress arc around active slots, and authentic food tint shift (raw -> sizzling amber -> golden crispy -> dark overcooked).
  - Scooping mechanic: Tap cooking item in pan to scoop onto the stainless steel `serving_plate`.
  - Order generation & evaluation: Dynamic customer orders generated from catalog; order fulfillment evaluated against plated items with bonuses for perfect frying and penalties for raw/burned items.
  - React HUD synced with coins/XP earnings and floating feedback notifications.
- **Verification Commands & Results**:
  - `pnpm run typecheck`: Passed (0 errors)
  - `pnpm run lint`: Passed (0 errors, 0 warnings)
  - `pnpm run format`: Passed (all files match Prettier style)
  - `pnpm run test`: Passed (3 test files, 14 tests passed)
  - `pnpm run build`: Passed (clean chunks, zero build errors)

## Current Architecture Decisions
1. **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Phaser 3 + Zustand.
2. **Backend**: Hono on Vercel Functions (`/api/v1/...`).
3. **Food Simulation**: Pure TypeScript `CookingManager` calculates deterministic cooking physics and state transitions, allowing identical logic across client and backend validation.
4. **Boundary Isolation**: Phaser GameObjects strictly isolated from Zustand/React state.
5. **Database (Prepared)**: Neon PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (scheduled for Phase 3).

## Next Phase
- **Phase 3 — PostgreSQL persistence**:
  - Neon PostgreSQL connection setup via `@neondatabase/serverless` and Drizzle ORM.
  - Database schema & migrations: `players`, `player_sessions`, `player_progress`, `order_runs`.
  - Guest identity endpoint (`POST /api/v1/session/guest`) providing opaque session tokens without login barriers.
  - Player profile restoration endpoint (`GET /api/v1/player`).
  - Server-authoritative order completion and reward endpoint (`POST /api/v1/orders/complete`) with idempotency key protection.
